# Tracking-Student-Performance

Between 2005 and 2007, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to determine the impact of tracking on student performance. Tracking is when classes are split according to student ability level. In 2005, 121 primary schools in western Kenya received funds to hire an extra first-grade teacher. These schools had a single first-grade class, and used the funds to split the class into two. In 60 randomly selected schools, pupils were assigned to sections based on prior achievement. In the remaining 61 schools, pupils were not tracked based on prior experience. Random assignment into the tracking treatment was stratified by the schoolâ€™s administrative zone.
